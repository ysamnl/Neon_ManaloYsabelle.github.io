			<p>For decades, there has been an ongoing debate whether the Marcos regime was indeed the ‘best’ era of the Philippines or not. Some claim that it was the ‘best’ era and revise our history. There are many misconceptions and false truths about the Marcos Regime. These misconceptions and false truths falsely guide the youth to believe that the late Ferdinand Marcos’ actions were justifiable. Some don’t even believe that there is anything to justify. This is why the Never Again website was created. </p>
			<p>The Never Again website aims to point out these misconception and false information and reveal the true nature of the Marcos regime. Never Again will be providing credible sources as well as a list of sources who are known to revise history and spread false information. The Never Again website is a way to educate the youth and to prevent the mistakes of the past Filipinos.</p>
