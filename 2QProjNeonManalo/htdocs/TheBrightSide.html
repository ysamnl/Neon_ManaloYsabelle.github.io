				<h3> Marcos' Ideology</h3>
			</header>
			<p>On May 12, 1982, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos released an essay entitled "The True Filipino Ideology." In this essay one of the things that the late dictator highlighted in his essay was the idea of a society of equals in a state of liberty. He also emphasized the importance of education and how illiteracy is not ignorance but educational deprivation. The essay can be accessed through the link below.<br>

				The late dictator had authority for 20 years before finally being ousted and exiled. Here are some of his notable achievements during his 20 years of rulership.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are some excerpts about the notable achievements of the Marcos regime from <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Ferdinand_Marcos">New World Encyclopedia</a>:
			</p>
			<p>
				1. Successful drive against smuggling. In 1966, more than 100 important smugglers were arrested; in three years 1966-1968 the arrests totaled 5,000. Military men involved in smuggling were forced to retire.
			</p>
			<p>
				2. Greater production of rice by promoting the cultivation of IR-8 hybrid rice. In 1968 the Philippines became self-sufficient in rice, the first time in history since the American period. In addition, the Philippines exported rice worth US$7 million.
			</p>
			<p>
				3. Land reform was given an impetus during the first term of President Marcos. 3,739 hectares of lands in Central Luzon were distributed to the farmers.
			</p>
			<p>
				4. In the field of foreign relations, the Philippines hosted the summit of seven heads of state (the United States, South [Vietnam]], South Korea, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines) to discuss the worsening problem in Vietnam and the containment of communism in the region.
				Likewise, President Marcos initiated, together with the other four heads of state of Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore), the formation of a regional organization to combat the communist threat in the region – the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
			</p>
			<p>
				5. Government finances were stabilized by higher revenue collections and loans from treasury bonds, foreign lending institutions and foreign governments.
			</p>	
			<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
			<p>
				Besides the notable achievements during the Marcos regime, there were also some lessons and gains from the abuse and damage that his regime caused. Here is a list of some lessons learned from his rule from <a href="https://globalnation.inquirer.net/129749/10-reasons-filipinos-should-be-grateful-to-marcos">INQUIRER.NET</a>:
			</P>
			<h3>Marcos taught us to disdain and reject bullies</h3>
			<p>
				Ferdinand Marcos was not the first, or the last, president to abuse his power. But, certainly, he set a seemingly unbreakable record. The nightmare of his 21 years in power still haunts us today, a powerful, constant reminder of a chapter in our history that must never be repeated. That’s worth something.
			</p>
			<h3>Marcos taught us to disdain leaders who flaunt their wealth.</h3>
			<p>
				To be fair, Marcos and Imelda did not invent wealth-flaunting. The elites have been doing that for generations well before he came to power. But the Marcoses certainly took the brazen display of extreme affluence, in the face of extreme poverty, to a new low. I mean how can how one justify owning 3,000 pairs of shoes and bragging about it?
			</p>
			<h3>Marcos taught us to be suspicious of leaders who acquire wealth.</h3>
			<p>
				Presidents who came after Marcos certainly ran into this problem. Yes, Philippine politics is still widely considered as an easy road to easy money, but too much greed is now generally accepted as being dangerous to one’s political career. And we have to give credit to Marcos for this, for making Filipinos extremely suspicious of political leaders who suddenly get rich.
			</p>
			<h3>Marcos taught us to disdain those who brazenly cheat in elections.</h3>
			<p>
				Now take note: I said “brazenly.” For I know, elections Philippine-style are still dirty and cheating-prone. But still, given our experience with Marcos, there’s a line, especially in national races, that I suspect candidates will not cross for fear of sparking a severe backlash.
			</p>
			<h3>Marcos showed us that there is a big difference between discipline and fear.</h3>
			<p>
			“Sa Ikauunlad ng Bayan, Disiplina ang Kailangan.” “For our nation to develop, we need discipline.” That was the regime’s slogan for Marcos’ New Society. It worked for a time, mainly because people knew that, by discipline, the dictator meant, “Shut up and submit, or else.” It got so bad that one U.S. official observed that the Philippines in the ‘70s and ‘80s had turned into a country of “40 million cowards and one SOB.” Well, Filipinos were willing to let that be the case only for so long.
